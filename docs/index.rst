Welcome to ds1054z's documentation!
===================================

Thanks for reading the documentation of the Python package ds1054z.
This software makes it easy to talk to your Rigol DS1054Z oscilloscope
or any DS1000Z / MSO1000Z series oscilloscope using Python.

ds1054z is free software, `published on Github`_ by Philipp Klaus.

It comes with a neat command line tool allowing you to control many
functions of your scope such as grabbing waveforms or screenshots,
or adjusting settings such as trigger, horizontol, or vertical setup.
